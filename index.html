            <p> Jorge Ben, also known as Jorge Ben Jor, is not only a great musician and songwriter but has pretty much created his own music style.
                 He became popular around the same time as Bossa Nova which was the prevalent music style in the main cities of Brazil,
                 but most importantly in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Benjor came up with his own brand of samba.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The song “Por Causa de Você Menina,” released in 1963 on the album “Samba Esquema Novo,” showed his new approach to samba and it wasn’t Bossa.
                     It was, nevertheless, readily embraced by the same youth who loved Bossa Nova.
                     The young people of Brazil in the late 50’s and 60’s needed to have their own music and sound – something they could relate to and that represented their generation. Benjor was it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Born in Rio de Janeiro in 1942 as Jorge Duilio Lima Menezes using the stage name first as Jorge Ben and later Jorge Benjor, Jorge Ben chose his name after his mother who was of Ethiopian origin.
                    Benjor’s music has always been based on samba and the beat of the escolas de samba of Rio. His brother introduced him to jazz and American music, including rock, as well. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are many other songs by Benjor that are very popular worldwide such as “País Tropical” and “Chove Chuva” and “Cadê Tereza”.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Jorge Benjor is also a big soccer fan. His team is Flamengo. He has written many songs related to soccer – a good example of this is “Flamengo”, “Ponta de Lança Africano”, “Fio Maravilha”, and “Zagueiro” among others.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While visiting Rio de Janeiro, President Barack Obama commented in his speech: “You are, as Jorge Benjor sang, a tropical country, blessed by God, and beautiful by nature” referring to “País Tropical.”
Benjor has recorded over 40 albums.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Jorge Benjor has received many awards in Brazil and abroad including the Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005.
